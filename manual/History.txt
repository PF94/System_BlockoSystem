<font:Palatino Linotype:24>RTB Timeline<font:Palatino Linotype:18>
Here is, as far as I can tell, the definitive RTB timeline. These are the most accurate dates that anyone will ever find, and anyone who says otherwise is itching for a fight. The timeline will be presented as a list, with a short note on why that date was important. The number indicated afterwards in parentheses contains little snippets of information cut from help files, websites, and posts, interjected with personal comments.

Features:
Cops and Robbers Mode
Editor Wand
3 new weapons - pick axe, blaster, pistol.
New bricks, by Rotondo

This was the version that gave birth to arguably some of RTB’s most famous and loved features, the editor wand, cops and robbers and movers. 

<spush><font:Palatino Linotype Bold:18>(3)<spop>
Features:
Movers now have triggers and can rotate.
The remote bomb and plunger.
Road plates.
RTB Isles and Celestial Dreams created.
New paint colors.
Brick ghosts are based on the model now, instead of a weird blue thing that doesn’t accurately show you the shape of the brick.
The jail system.
Keys were added, you could lock doors.

Hey, Ephialtes and Mocheeze both graduated from the “special thanks” section to the full credits! Also, we see the development of RTB’s background, produced by “TommyLM”.

Here we see emergence of the RTB updater. Possibly the most annoying feature ever. When the website was moved to a new server, the auto-updater kept popping up every start up. Despite later patches, it never seemed to quite get fixed.

Hello RTB users. We have some unhappy news. We're closing down RTB forever :( . Version 1.04 was the last one. Many of you know that we've been talking about shutting down for a couple weeks now, so this might not be a surprise to some of you. Just because we're quitting Blockland doesn't mean that you have to also. There is another mod pack out there that you will enjoy just as much.

AiO is probably the best mod out there beside RTB. AiO stands for "All in One", so you know that you'll still be getting a very full experience in Blockland. They have many of the features that we do, like the IRC chat. They also have additional bricks, and WAY more maps than us. Why would we tell you to use AiO? Because it's really the only other alternative to RTB that would be worth downloading. And the guys that make AiO are a good bunch of folks that are easy to get along with. :)

We're sorry if this is disappointing news, it wasn't easy to come to this decision. Maybe we will start up again when Retail Blockland is released. Until then, we'll see you around in AiO!

- Astro, BlueGreen, Ephialtes, Mocheeze, Nitramtj and Rititundo.

The forums were down as well, but this wasn’t intended to be part of the joke- they deleted them on accident.

Never released publicly, this was an auto-updater test.

Thanks for downloading RTB 1051!
New features include:
- A new folder called Fork in your client folder.
- A text document with some stupid text in it.

Had development continued, the mod would have checked to see if the mod version number was the same as the RTB server’s. If it wasn’t, it would automatically install the latest version. This is basically the same system used in RTB2.

For the first time in nearly 2 years, RTB’s beta testers had something to test. Those that weren’t dead returned to test the latest version. It was released over SVN, and for the first time ever, beta testers could get the latest version instantly and give feedback on changes made quickly. Now the SVN is down- RTB automatically updates.
