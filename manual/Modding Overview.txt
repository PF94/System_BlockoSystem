You are able to register preferences to be managed by super admins on the server using a small chunk of code.

You can insert direct links to RTB files by using the following custom TorqueML:

<a<spop>:rtb-ID>File Title<<spop>/a>

And when clicked, will open that file in the Mod Manager for anyone who has RTB.
