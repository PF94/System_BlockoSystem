RTB can also be run on your dedicated server to allow people to see what players are on your server, or what add-ons you have. You will first need to enable RTB in the Add-Ons menu of the Start a Server window to make sure it gets loaded with the dedicated server.

<lmargin:20><font:Palatino Linotype Bold:20>Help<font:Palatino Linotype:18>
You can get a list of commands by typing rtbHelp(); into your dedicated server.

<font:Palatino Linotype Bold:20>Setting Up RTB<font:Palatino Linotype:18>
RTB requires you to enter your username as part of the authentication process for starting a server. The easiest way to do this is simply to join your own dedicated server, and it will say "RTB Authentication Successful" in the console. You should only ever have to do this once, unless you re-install.

You can update the RTB version for the dedicated server by typing checkRTBUpdates(); into your dedicated server.
